# lgportfolio

LGPortfolio is an online portfolio for a friend architect.

This is a personal project I created to start learning my way through the numerous, diverse and highly enticing paths of web programming.

Technologies: Bootstrap and the MEAN Stack (MongoDB - Express - AngularJS - Node.js)

This project is still under development, but you can check it out on https://architectureportfolio.herokuapp.com/. I am currently working on the layout.
